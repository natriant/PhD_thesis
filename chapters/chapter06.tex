\section{Benchmarking with different simulation software}
Benchmarking of theory with pyheadtail (one turn map) and Sixtracklib (element by element tracking).

\subsection{PyHEADTAIL}
\subsection{Sixtracklib}

\section{Sensitivity to the non-linearities of the main SPS dipoles}
Simulation studies with sixtracklib

\section{Simulations using the measured noise spectrum}
Sixtracklib PyHEADTAIL and the exact machine paramters

\section{Sensitvity studies}
1. Sensitvity to how noisy is the noise spectrum
2. On the CC voltage
3. On the different bunch lengths. 

\section{b3b5b7 multiple errors}
Contribution of the non-linearities with sixtracklib.


All these factors were excluded as possible sources of the discrepancy.
