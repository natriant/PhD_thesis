\section{Benchmarking with different simulation software}
Benchmarking of theory with pyheadtail (one turn map) and Sixtracklib (element by element tracking).

\subsection{PyHEADTAIL}
- real CC element
- local vs global cc scheme
- How emittance is computed. No dipsersive contribution. studies vertical plane. \\
- It was verified in Sixtracklib simulations that the result from this simplified implementation is equivalent to the simulation with the true CC kick including phase noise.\\
- Need to say why in the simulations we have excitation of only the first betatron sideband. \\
\subsection{Sixtracklib}

Remember that in chapter 6 it was demonstrated that there is no visible difference on the cc rf noise induced emittance growth if the noise kicks are modeled as kicks on the moemntum or the real rf multiple + used in a global or local scheme.
