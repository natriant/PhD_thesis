During the dedicated experiment that took place in the SPS
in 2018 with the CCs, the measured emittance
growth was found to be a factor four (on average) lower than
expected from the theory (see Section~\ref{sec:meas_2018_vs_theory}). The reason for this discrepancy remained unresolved for some time, as detailed follow-up studies (see Chapter~\ref{Ch:investigating_discrepancy}) investigated and excluded a number of possible explanations for the discrepancy.
It was recently found, that the beam transverse impedance, which is not included in the theory~\cite{PhysRevSTAB.18.101001} used for the comparison with the measurements may impact the noise-induced emittance growth and explain the experimental observations.
