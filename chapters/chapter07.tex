During the dedicated experiment that took place in the SPS
in 2018 with the CCs, the measured emittance
growth was found to be a factor four (on average) lower than
expected from the theory (see Section~\ref{sec:meas_2018_vs_theory}). The reason for this discrepancy remained unresolved for some time as detailed follow-up studies (see Chapter~\ref{Ch:investigating_discrepancy}) investigated and excluded a number of possible explanations for the discrepancy.





%excluded the possibility that the discrepancy is a result of factors such as the choice of simulation softwate, or the actual noise level of noise in the CCs.
