% This first paragraph is slightly modified from the phd description:
To extend the physics reach of the main experiments of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the machine will undergo a major upgrade during the coming years. This upgrade, namely the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project, aims at about a five-fold increase of the yearly luminosity production with proton beams comparing to the present LHC operation. Reaching these ambitious luminosity goals the precise control and minimization of beam degradation (such as losses and emittance growth) is critical. A particular challenge is associated with the fact that HL-LHC will employ Crab Cavities to compensate the crossing angle of the colliding bunches, ande hence to restore the head-on collisions, in the two main experiments (ATLAS and CMS). However, these Crab Cavities are expected to result in undesired transverse emittance growth due to noise in their RF control system, and therefore loss of luminosity. %  by residual noise on the beam introduced by the crab cavity RF control. 
Given to the very tight HL-LHC target values for luminosity loss and emittance growth from the Crab Cavities (the values are given in the Introduction chapter)
a solid understanding of the emittance growth due to Crab Cavity RF noise is essential.



To study the potential transverse emittance growth induced by the crab cavities, two prototype crab cavities have been installed in the SPS in 201


\newpage
- The use of damper is an appropriate configuration as it provides dipolar noise kicks in the beam and as shown in Chapter 7 the suppression mechanism is related ot the dipole motion. 
- More machine time. no cryo module and team needed. only two people..
- Less uncertainties from CC setup.

Detailed studies with PyHEADTAIL showed that the emittance growth suppression can reach up to a factor of 2-4 for crab cavity phase noise when the bunch length is longer than the cavity wavelength, which was the case for the SPS experiments. However, for short bunch lengths, which will be the case in the HL-LHC, the suppression factor was found to be similar to the case of pure dipolar noise reaching a factor of 10. The scope of this project is also to characterize the impact of the crab cavities in the long-term emittance evolution in HL-LHC. Thus, the interplay of the transverse impedance and the transverse feedback system, which is planned to suppress the crab cavity noise induced emittance growth in HL-LHC, started being investigated. The first simulation results indicate that the emittance suppression from the feedback system is not affected by the impedance, due to the much faster damping time of the former.
