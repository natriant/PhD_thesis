- The use of damper is an appropriate configuration as it provides dipolar noise kicks in the beam and as shown in Chapter 7 the suppression mechanism is related ot the dipole motion. 
- More machine time. no cryo module and team needed. only two people..
- Less uncertainties from CC setup.

Detailed studies with PyHEADTAIL showed that the emittance growth suppression can reach up to a factor of 2-4 for crab cavity phase noise when the bunch length is longer than the cavity wavelength, which was the case for the SPS experiments. However, for short bunch lengths, which will be the case in the HL-LHC, the suppression factor was found to be similar to the case of pure dipolar noise reaching a factor of 10. The scope of this project is also to characterize the impact of the crab cavities in the long-term emittance evolution in HL-LHC. Thus, the interplay of the transverse impedance and the transverse feedback system, which is planned to suppress the crab cavity noise induced emittance growth in HL-LHC, started being investigated. The first simulation results indicate that the emittance suppression from the feedback system is not affected by the impedance, due to the much faster damping time of the former.
