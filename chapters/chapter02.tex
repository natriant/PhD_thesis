For a gaussian beam distribution the normalised beam emittance is defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:emit_from_beam_size}
    \epsilon_{x} = \frac{\sigma_x(s)^2 - \delta^2 D_x^2(s)}{\beta_x(s)} \betarel \gammarel
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_x(s)$ is the beam size, $\beta_x(s)$ is the beta function, $D_x(s)$ is the dispersion fat a specific location s along the accelerator, $\delta=\Delta p/p0$ is the momentum spread and $\betarel, \gammarel$ the relativistic parameters. Similar expression is valid for the vertical plane, with the difference that there is no dispersion.
