For a gaussian beam distribution the normalised beam emittance is defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:emit_from_beam_size}
    \epsilon_{x} = \frac{\sigma_x(s)^2 - \delta^2 D_x^2(s)}{\beta_x(s)} \betarel \gammarel
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_x(s)$ is the beam size, $\beta_x(s)$ is the beta function, $D_x(s)$ is the dispersion fat a specific location s along the accelerator, $\delta=\Delta p/p0$ is the momentum spread and $\betarel, \gammarel$ the relativistic parameters. Similar expression is valid for the vertical plane, with the difference that there is no dispersion.

\normalsize{\textbf{Standard deviation}}\\
The standard deviation (SD) is a measure of the spread of a set of values. It is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x_i-\mu)^2}}{N}},
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation $N$ is the size of the set, $x_i$ each value of the set and $\mu$ the mean of the set.
