In 2018, two prototype Crab Cavities (CCs) were installed in the SPS to be tested for the first time
with proton beams. One of the operational issues that needed to be addressed concerned the expected 
emittance growth due to noise in their RF control system. A theoretical model had already been developed
and validated by tracking simulations~\cite{PhysRevSTAB.18.101001}. Based on those studies a dedicated 
experiment was performed to benchmark the models with experimental data and to confirm the analytical
 predictions. In particular, the idea was to inject various noise levels in the CC RF system and record
 the emittance evolution. In this chapter, the measurement results from the experiment are presented 
 and discussed.
