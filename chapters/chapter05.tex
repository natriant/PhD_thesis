\section{Experimental procedure}
\begin{sloppypar} % to fix \hbox too wide
The beam and machine conditions for the emittance growth studies were discussed extensively in Chapter~\ref{Ch:2018_setup} and are listed in Tables~\ref{tab:machine_beam_param_2018} and~\ref{tab:SPS_CC_main}. In principle the measurements were performed with four bunches at 270\,GeV with low intensity (3 $\times \mathrm{10^{10}}$ ppb) with linear chromaticity corrected to to $\sim$ 1. Only $\CC2$ was used, providing a vertical kick to the beam.

\normalsize{\textbf{Injected RF noise}}\\
 In order to characterize the CC noise induced emittance growth, artificial noise was injected into their LLRF system and the bunch evolution was recorded for about 20-40 minutes. The injected noise was a mixture of amplitude and phase noise up to 10\,kHz, overlapping and primarily exciting the first betatron sideband at $\sim 8$\,kHz. The phase noise was always dominant. Figure~\ref{fig:example_PN_and_AN} dsiplays two example measurements of phase (left) and amplitude (right) noise acquired during the experiment with a sepctrum analyzer E5052B~\cite{E5052B_insight}.

This spectrum analyzer provides a single sideband measurement (SSB), which is expressed as $10\log_{10}\mathcal{L}(f)$\,[dBc/Hz]. 



Regarding the relation with the theoretical model 



 After the examples mention the need for introducing the effective phase noise. (Do I need extra details?)
 

 - effective noise
 - Comparison to the theroeical --> mention further explanation is provided ip
