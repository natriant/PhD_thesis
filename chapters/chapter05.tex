The beam and machine conditions for the emittance growth studies were discussed extensively in Chapter~\ref{Ch:2018_setup} and are listed in Tables~\ref{tab:machine_beam_param_2018} and~\ref{tab:SPS_CC_main}. In principle the measurements were performed with four bunches at 270\,GeV with low intensity (3 $\times \mathrm{10^{10}}$ ppb) with linear chromaticity corrected to $\sim$ 1. Only $\CC2$ was used, provided a vertical kick on the beam. In order to characterize the CC noise induced emittance growth, different levels of controlled noise were injected into its LLRF system and the bunch evolution was recorded for about 20-40 minutes (for each noise setting). Three "coasts", with the same settings, were carried out, since a new beam was injected every time the quality of the beam was seen to be degraded e.g.  very large beam size.

In this Chapter the measurements that were performed during the experiment and their analysis are presented. In Section~\ref{sec:CC_voltage_meas2018} the calibration of the $\CC$ voltage is displayed. Section~\ref{sec:noise_meas2018} elaborates on the injected noise and the acquistions of the power spectrum. Thereafter, in Section~\ref{sec:EmitGrowth_measurements} the measured emittance growth, which is the paramter of primary interest, is discussed. Furthermore, the measurements of the bunch length are examined in Section~\ref{sec:bunch_length_measurements_2018} while the intensity evolution is shown in Section~\ref{sec:intensity_measurements_2018} for completness. Section~\ref{sec:meas_2018_vs_theory} compares the measured emittance growth rates with the predictions of the theoretical model introduced in Chapter~\ref{Ch:CC_noise_theory}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:MD2018_summary} summarizes the main experimental findings.


\section{CC voltage}\label{sec:CC_voltage_meas2018}

The emittance growth measurements started around $\sim$ 10:30 and lasted till $\sim$ 17:00. The targeted $\CC$ voltage was 1\, MV. A reference measurement for the voltage calibration was made with the HT monitor before the start of the noise injection and the emittance growth measurements while a second one took place at $\sim$ 13:50 between the first and the seond "coast". The calibrated voltage (see Section~\ref{subsec:HT_post_process_CC}) from these HT acquisitions is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:VCC_MD5_2018} left and and right respectively.

% Observation: 1. Signals assymetric. Enhanced due to higher energy 2. the crabbing is less visible in the density plots due to higher energy. 3. We assume that the CC settings didnt change throught the coast. 4. The experts appear confident that the votlage was 1 MV.

The $\CC$ voltage is estimated, from the peak to peak amplitude, at 0.76\,MV and 0.97\,MV from the first and second acquisition respectively. For the direct comparison of the measured growth rates with measuremnts and simulations (section.. ) and Ch... the average of the two values is used, $\VCC$ = 0.865\,MV. \textcolor{red}{The unceratinties on the Vcc to be discussed.} This consideration is based on the assumption that the $\CC$ settings remained unchanged during the experiment.

\section{Injected RF noise}\label{sec:noise_meas2018}
\begin{sloppypar} % to fix \hbox too wide
 The injected noise was a mixture of amplitude and phase noise up to 10\,kHz, overlapping and primarily exciting the first betatron sideband at $\sim 8$\,kHz. The phase noise was always dominant. Figure~\ref{fig:example_PN_and_AN} dsiplays two example measurements of phase (left) and amplitude (right) noise acquired during the experiment with a sepctrum analyzer E5052B~\cite{E5052B_insight}.

As already discussed in Chapter~\ref{Ch:CC_noise_theory} the noise induced emittance growth rate depends on the noise power on the betatron for phase noise and on the synchrobetatron sidebands for amplitude noise.

\begin{sloppypar} % to fix \hbox too wide
This spectrum analyzer provides a single sideband measurement (SSB), which is expressed as $10\log_{10}\mathcal{L}(f)$\,[dBc/Hz]. Its relation with the power spectral densities (PSDs) introduced in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dey_an} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:dey_pn} are given by $S_\Delta = 2\mathcal{L}(f)$~\cite{IEEE:4797525}, with $S_{\Delta A}$ in 1/Hz and $S_{\Delta\phi}$ in rad$^2$/Hz. A detailed discussion on the noise power measurements and their relation to the mathimatical defintion of the PSD is given in Chapter [tba].

As already mentioned above, the injected noise was a combination of both phase and amplitude noise. Therefore, in order to make a meaningful comparison between the different noise levels the concept of effective phase noise is introduced. This is the phase noise level that would lead to
the same emittance growth as that from both phase and
amplitude noise. The noise levels mentioned in this chapter correspond to the calculated effective phase noise.
% should I slightly change this paragraph? Too much copy paste from IPAC or it's ok?

\section{Emittance growth measurements}\label{sec:EmitGrowth_measurements}

An overview of the emittance growth measurments is shown in Fig ... for both horizontal (top) and vertical (bottom) plane. The three "coasts" are distinguishable with the black dashed vertical lines. For each "coast" a nea beam was injected with the same targeted initial conditions. The different levels of injected noise are displayed in the plot (bottom) while the moments at which the noise level changed are shown with the grey dashed vertical lines. These noise levels correspond to the average of the effective phase noise over the four bunches



Seven different noise levels were studied

The measurements for characterizing the $\CC$ noise induced emittance growth lasted ~ 7 hours. The emittance evolution was recordered for seven different noise levels.

- For the AN we are interested in fb+-qs. however we consider its flat and we keep the value of fb. Nevetherless the impact from the AN should be very small.
