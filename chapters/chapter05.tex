 This chapter is adapted from the the studies published in Ref.~\cite{Triantafyllou}

- Injected noise. Show two examples of amplitude and phase noise spectra. Reference to the chapter where the relation between the measured and the noise as mentioned in the theoretical model is explained.

- Emittance growth measurements. (maybe take the average growth from IN and OUT. Very similar in 2018. If you do this, change the error estimation and the discussion in Ch4.)

- bunch length measurements, from both instruments. 

- Bunch profiles and relative position from wall current monitor unstable bunches.

- No losses were observed (don't show measurements). Maybe in the appendix you can add the intensity plot.

\section{Experimental procedure}



 \section{Injected RF noise} 

 In order to characterize the CC noise induced emittance growth, controlled noise was injected into their LLRF system and the evolution of the bunch was recorded for about 20-40 minutes. The injected noise was a mixture of amplitude and phase noise up to 10 KHz, overlapping and primarily exciting the fisrt betatron sideband at $\sim 8$ kHz. The phase noise was always dominant.
